The Ida block set were known as Ida Boys, Ida Rydaz, Ida Bloodstarz, and Graveyard Family and repped the colour red, the official colour of the Bloods.

The red and burgundy colour association is in reference to the red bricks that make up the estates in the area.

Tiverton has been active since the 80s and were originally part of TMD and were part of the “south Tottenham alliance” along with Ida Road, Edgecot Grove, Bourne and Twyford blocks, and the Stonebridge estate, between Seven Sisters Road, St Ann’s Road and Tottenham High Road) (not to be confused with the Stonebridge estate in Brent).

This connection to the Bloods gang is thought to have originated with arrival of a deported New Yorker and Miller Gangsta Blood member, Alexander Baker aka Miller Gunz. He was deported back to Britain in 2005 after US authorities learnt he had been born in the United Kingdom.

Somali members who would gain access to the drugs market from the more experienced Jamaican olders would eventually organise the Somali youth under their wing and break off to form their own organisation, becoming rivals.

Unlike other gangs who beef over postcodes or personal issues, Mali Boys beef is often based upon their imposing onto the drug turf of other gangs.

While the Mali Boys maintain a very low profile on social media, they have been known to use it to gather information on rivals and police for the purpose of intimidation and fear. They have been known to spy and maintain very detailed records on police stations, undercover police officers and cars. In some instances, they have been known to force local business owners to destroy CCTV footage that could be used by authorities to link members to crimes.","Drive/ GMB/ DM (Walthamstow/ E17), Boundary (Walthamstow/ E17)"," 6th/ ACG (Beckton, E6), Beaumont Boys/ LGR (Leyton Green), BHR (Blackhorse Lane), Priory Court, Higham Hill, Woodford, Chingford, Leytonstone",
