# README: Bellingcat Hackathon - London Gang Culture Investigation

## Project Overview
This repository hosts our project for the Bellingcat Hackathon, focusing on understanding gang culture in London through the lens of UK Drill music. Our team has developed a set of tools, datasets, and an article to aid researchers in exploring London gang culture and related gang violence.

### Key Components
1. **Website:** Provides a explanation of our investigation. Access it [HERE](https://a-jiwa.github.io/investigating-uk-drill/)
2. **Command Line Tools:**
   - **Lyric Fetcher:** Retrieves the lyrics of all songs by a specified artist.
   - **Artist Similarity Matrix Tool:** Generates a similarity matrix for a set of artists using Machine Learning (ML) to uncover connections.
   - **Song Similarity Matrix Tool:** Creates a similarity matrix for a set of songs to discover connections, leveraging ML techniques.
   - **Aggressiveness Assessment Model:** An ML model that evaluates the aggressiveness of an artist based on their songs.
   - **Translate Slang:** Takes song lyrics, and translates slang words into thier real meannings
3. **Datasets:**
   - **London Gangs Dataset:** Contains information on most main London gangs, including members, descriptions, 'opps' (opponents), and allies.
   - **Slang Terms Dataset:** A comprehensive list of slang terms used in UK Drill music, with their real meanings.
   - **Gang Locations Map:** A geolocated map showing the locations of all major gangs in London.
4. **Research Article:** A written piece providing deep insights into our findings and methodologies.
